From This Chapter to the Next — Thank You!

Hi Team,

It’s not easy to say goodbye to a place where I’ve grown, struggled, laughed, and learned so much. These years with you all have been more than just “work” they’ve been a journey filled with experiences that I’ll always carry with me.

I want to take a moment to sincerely thank <my leads> who guided me with clarity, supported me through challenges, and most importantly trusted me when I was still finding my way. Your belief in me made all the difference.

Bhimesh — my guru. Your mentorship was more than just technical guidance. it was patience, and belief that helped shape who I am today. Thank you for being that light.

Shishir - thank you for being a constant source of inspiration. Your kindness, encouragement, and calm leadership left a lasting impression on me. I’ll carry those lessons forward with pride and gratitude.

And my team <team DL> my pride, I want to thank each and every one of you  who stood by me, helped me survive the early challenges, supported my learning curve, and shaped the career I’m so proud of today. I truly feel lucky to have started my journey with a team that became more like family.

There’s a line that’s been echoing in my mind "Building a dream from your memory is the easiest way of losing your grasp on what’s real and what isn’t." 
And I think that’s the beauty of moving forward we carry the memories, but we live the reality. While it’s tempting to hold on, I know it’s time to step into a new dream. And I do that with a heart full of gratitude.

As I sail into a new chapter, my heart remains anchored in the memories we've made here. Let’s stay in touch!
