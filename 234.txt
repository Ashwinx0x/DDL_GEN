Thank you for bringing this to our attention. While we implemented the required changes in the IICS mapping and saw the session changes reflecting, during workflow execution in IICS monitor we were unable to view the PDO value in the runtime session. This caused confusion, led to the job running longer than expected, and in parallel we reached out to the admin team while also checking alternative solutions.
We acknowledge that the change identified was a simple one, and we truly appreciate your prompt input which helped us resolve it faster. Going forward, we will ensure a more structured approach—completing all workaround checks before escalation—to avoid such situations.
We value your feedback and will take this as a learning to strengthen our process and collaborate more effectively as one team.
